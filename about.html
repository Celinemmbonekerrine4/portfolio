        <h3><br><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <p><br><b>Am Celine Mmbone a 19year old.
        <br>Am the first born in a family of Three.
        <br>I finished my primary school in October 2014 in Joysprings Educational Center.   
        <br>I finished high school in November 2018 in Soweto Academy. 
        <br>Then i joined Carolina for Kibera where i studied Certificate in Computer for 3months.
        <br></b></p>
        <p><br><b>Currently am in Moringa school pursuing Programming course, for the next 6 months.
            <br>I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development.
            <br>At the moment i have skills on <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.
        </b></p>
             <p><br><b>I decided to study programing because am given a chance to create anything i want.
            <br>Programming gives you the ability to digitize your ideas.
            <br>Programing gives people money for instance.
            <br>You will only make money when you can solve other peopleâ€™s problems and help them achieve their dreams. 
            <br>That is effectively what a job actually is by definition.</b></p>
